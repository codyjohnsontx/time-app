# Watch Time Assistant

Welcome to my time app! As a watch lover with an affinity for timepieces, I created this application to solve common challenges in setting and using mechanical watches. This tool provides several time-related utilities in one convenient place.

## Features

- Visual reference to help align hour, minute, and second hands
- Synchronization countdown to help set your watch to the exact second

- Easy-to-read format that helps with watches using either display type

### Time Zone Utilities

- Convert times between multiple international time zones
- UTC reference clock for world time watches
- Time zone difference calculator for travel planning

### Watch Enthusiast Tools

- Sunrise/sunset times for watches with day/night indicators
- Moon phase information for lunar complication watches
- Date change warning to prevent setting watches during date change danger zones
